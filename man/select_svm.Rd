\title{Function basically performing the same task as e1071::tune, but here made
clear.}
\usage{
select_svm(input_frame, kernel = "linear", max.polynomial = 2,
  cachesize = 8000, min_lag = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_frame}{A data frame containing a date and a price.}

\item{cachesize}{cache memory in MB (default 4000)}

\item{max.cost}{An integer containing the maximum allowed cost. If left as
NULL, it will default to floor(max(abs(price)) + 3 * sd(price))}

\item{max.epsilon}{An interger being the max allowed epsilon parameter. If
left as null, it will default to 4, being the value where no support vectors
